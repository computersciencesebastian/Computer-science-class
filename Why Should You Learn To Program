Programming is another skill that you could learn either to get a job or have a hobby or maybe its just something you think that would be useful to know.
In my opinion, learning to program is a skill that i would want to learn how to do because it could show up as a oppurtunity for me later in life. 
For example, if your struggling financially and you cannot do anything else then maybe u can find a gig that could serve as extra money, or maybe you need to program something like
a device to help your needs if your not feeling so well physically or maybe you just need a robot or something to remind you. Never the less, learning how to program is something 
that wouldnt hurt for you to learn.
